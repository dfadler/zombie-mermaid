Add `architecture-beta` diagrams (Mermaid's native syntax: `group`, `service`, `junction`, port-sided edges, `{group}` edges). They are lowered to the flowchart model and render in SVG and ASCII; ports steer flow direction rather than an exact grid, and icons are not drawn. `DIAGRAM_TYPES` gains `'architecture'`.
