**BREAKING:** `elkjs` is now an optional peer dependency of `@zombie-mermaid/svg-renderer` (and no longer a dependency of `@zombie-mermaid/core`), and the library no longer imports it. Browser and bundler apps that render flowchart, state, class, ER or architecture diagrams must `npm install elkjs` and call the new `registerElk(ELK)` once (`import ELK from 'elkjs/lib/elk.bundled.js'`); otherwise rendering those diagrams throws `ElkNotRegisteredError`. Under Node and Bun, `elkjs` is auto-loaded when installed, and `zombie-mermaid` and `@zombie-mermaid/mcp` still depend on it, so the CLI and MCP server need no change. Sequence, pie, xychart, C4 and ASCII output never needed it. In exchange, the SVG renderer's browser bundle drops from about 518 KB to 74 KB gzipped (umbrella 576 KB to 130 KB) when elk is not registered, and the published `.d.ts` files no longer import from `elkjs` (the `Elk*` graph types are now exported by `@zombie-mermaid/core`). See `docs/guides/elkjs-optional-peer.md`.
