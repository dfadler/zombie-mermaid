Add C4 diagram support (`C4Context`, `C4Container`, `C4Component`, `C4Dynamic`, `C4Deployment`) in SVG and ASCII with dedicated renderers. `DiagramType` gains `'c4'`, and `detectDiagramType` routes the C4 headers to it. C4 sources are parsed by a new `parseC4Diagram` in `@zombie-mermaid/mermaid-parser`, which records `Rel_U/D/L/R` placement hints. The SVG renderer lays out with ELK (nested boundaries, relationships to boundaries) and draws a person glyph, cylinders, queues, the C4 palette, boundary frames, a title, and relationship labels with a separate `[technology]` line. The ASCII renderer has its own row layout, boxes, boundary frames, and grid router. `Rel_D`/`Rel_U` steer layering; `Rel_R`/`Rel_L` place elements side by side (exact in ASCII, a best-effort nudge in SVG). Prior art: lukilabs/beautiful-mermaid#34 (kristjanakkermann) and #71 (devx), both unmerged upstream; nothing was copied from either. ArchiMate remains open under #1167. Part of #1167.
