Output change: pie charts now honour `%%{init: {"pie": {"legendPosition": ...}}}%%` and `highlightSlice` in SVG, as Mermaid 12.1.0 does. `legendPosition` takes `right` (the default, unchanged), `left`, `top`, `bottom` or `center`: left and top shift the pie to make room, top and bottom make the frame taller, and center draws the legend over the pie. An unknown value draws the default. `highlightSlice: "<label>"` draws the slice with that exact label 5% larger and fully opaque; `hover` has no meaning in a static image and is ignored. Charts that set neither option are byte-identical, and the ASCII output ignores both. Closes [#1725](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/issues/1725) and [#1726](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/issues/1726).
