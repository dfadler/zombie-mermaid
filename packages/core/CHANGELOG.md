# @zombie-mermaid/core

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#1122](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/pull/1122) [`d7777fe`](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/commit/d7777fe87a500c6b402c48b298d096f26ef6e130) Thanks [@dfadler](https://github.com/dfadler)! - Remove the unused `componentSpacing` field from `RenderOptions` /
  `FlowchartRenderOptions`. It was a no-op accepted only for forward
  compatibility and was never read by any renderer. This narrows the public
  `FlowchartRenderOptions` type — a TypeScript consumer passing
  `componentSpacing` in a strictly-typed object literal will now see a type
  error, though no runtime behavior changes since the field was never used.

## 2.2.6

## 2.2.5

## 2.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#1069](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/pull/1069) [`dc6d5e9`](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/commit/dc6d5e9e4c9a90f06aebb56ff3a41fc47439ae66) Thanks [@dfadler](https://github.com/dfadler)! - Fix diagonal edge-routing arrowheads (`◢◣◤◥`) falling back to an unpinned
  system font in ASCII output: JetBrains Mono NL has no glyph for them at
  all ([#1062](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/issues/1062)), so `drawArrowHead` now draws `↖↗↘↙` instead — real,
  correctly-directional glyphs the font does have. Also fixes an
  `isWideChar` misclassification the new glyphs would otherwise hit.
