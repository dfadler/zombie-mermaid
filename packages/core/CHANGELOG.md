### Patch Changes

- [#1069](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/pull/1069) [`dc6d5e9`](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/commit/dc6d5e9e4c9a90f06aebb56ff3a41fc47439ae66) Thanks [@dfadler](https://github.com/dfadler)! - Fix diagonal edge-routing arrowheads (`◢◣◤◥`) falling back to an unpinned
  system font in ASCII output: JetBrains Mono NL has no glyph for them at
  all ([#1062](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/issues/1062)), so `drawArrowHead` now draws `↖↗↘↙` instead — real,
  correctly-directional glyphs the font does have. Also fixes an
  `isWideChar` misclassification the new glyphs would otherwise hit.
