# @zombie-mermaid/core

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1173](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/pull/1173) [`1357207`](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/commit/1357207528b0cfee8fa7fb43513813a5f714a36e) Thanks [@dfadler](https://github.com/dfadler)! - MCP server: `render_mermaid_svg` gains optional `bg`/`fg` hex color overrides (applied on top of `theme`) and an optional `outputPath` that writes the SVG to a `.svg` file and returns `{ saved, size }`. `outputPath` is path-safe: it must resolve inside the server's working directory, the parent must already exist, and symlinks, `..` traversal, and non-regular files are refused. Because it can write files, `render_mermaid_svg` is now annotated `readOnlyHint: false, destructiveHint: true`. Two new tools, `list_themes` and `list_diagram_types`, list the valid `theme` names and the supported diagram types. `@zombie-mermaid/core` now exports a runtime `DIAGRAM_TYPES` array that `DiagramType` is derived from.

  Adapted by hand (not imported) from upstream lukilabs/beautiful-mermaid#120 (by LordCasser) and [#42](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/issues/42) (by manuareraa), keeping this fork's camelCase inputs and enum theme validation.

### Patch Changes

- [#1163](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/pull/1163) [`14c5945`](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/commit/14c59452176f73e171aa459f69d2cee2ad7e7b34) Thanks [@dfadler](https://github.com/dfadler)! - Round every coordinate/dimension interpolated into generated SVG markup (flowchart, ER, class, and sequence diagrams) to 2 decimal places instead of emitting full floating-point precision (e.g. `142.38427299999998`). Output is visually identical — 2 decimal places is well beyond the smallest rendering difference a browser draws — but noticeably smaller and easier to read or diff by hand. `xychart`'s own existing rounding is unchanged. (Ported from a fix by GauBen, upstream [lukilabs/beautiful-mermaid#77](https://github.com/lukilabs/beautiful-mermaid/pull/77).)

### Major Changes

- [#1122](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/pull/1122) [`d7777fe`](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/commit/d7777fe87a500c6b402c48b298d096f26ef6e130) Thanks [@dfadler](https://github.com/dfadler)! - Remove the unused `componentSpacing` field from `RenderOptions` /
  `FlowchartRenderOptions`. It was a no-op accepted only for forward
  compatibility and was never read by any renderer. This narrows the public
  `FlowchartRenderOptions` type — a TypeScript consumer passing
  `componentSpacing` in a strictly-typed object literal will now see a type
  error, though no runtime behavior changes since the field was never used.

### Patch Changes

- [#1069](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/pull/1069) [`dc6d5e9`](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/commit/dc6d5e9e4c9a90f06aebb56ff3a41fc47439ae66) Thanks [@dfadler](https://github.com/dfadler)! - Fix diagonal edge-routing arrowheads (`◢◣◤◥`) falling back to an unpinned
  system font in ASCII output: JetBrains Mono NL has no glyph for them at
  all ([#1062](https://github.com/dfadler/zombie-mermaid/issues/1062)), so `drawArrowHead` now draws `↖↗↘↙` instead — real,
  correctly-directional glyphs the font does have. Also fixes an
  `isWideChar` misclassification the new glyphs would otherwise hit.
